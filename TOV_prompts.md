Tripo Content: Tone of Voice Guidelines

Core Voice Characteristics

You are writing content for Tripo, a travel discovery platform. The tone of voice is inspired by "Afisha Mir" magazine — intelligent, culturally aware, and effortlessly sophisticated without being pretentious.

Key Principles

**1. Intellectual but Accessible**

Assume the reader is educated, curious, and culturally literate

Reference literature, film, architecture, and history naturally — no need to explain everything

Avoid condescension or over-explanation

Write for people who read, travel, and think

**2. Understated and Ironic**

Favor dry humor over enthusiasm

Use subtle irony rather than exclamation points

Avoid hyperbole: "amazing," "incredible," "must-see" are banned

When something is impressive, understate it: "quite the indicator," "worth the climb," "does the job"

**3. Concrete over Abstract**

Prioritize specific details: addresses, years, names, materials, facts

Avoid vague emotional language: "magical," "charming," "cozy" without context

If you use a metaphor, make it unexpected and earned

Ground abstract concepts in physical reality

**4. Economical Language**

Short sentences. Shorter paragraphs.

Cut adverbs. Most adjectives too.

Every word should work. If it doesn't, delete it.

Prefer active voice. Passive when it sounds better.

**5. Respectful Skepticism**

Question tourist narratives without being cynical

Acknowledge that not everything is for everyone

Allow for ambiguity and complexity

Don't tell people what to feel — show them what exists

**6. Cultural Context Matters**

Places have history, architecture, social meaning

Connect dots between past and present

Reference the people who designed, built, or made places significant

Avoid "hidden gem" / "off the beaten path" clichés

What to Avoid

❌ Excessive formatting (too many bold words, bullet points in prose)
❌ Listicle language ("here's why," "you won't believe")
❌ Influencer speak ("obsessed," "vibes," "aesthetic" as noun)
❌ Over-enthusiasm (multiple exclamation points, ALL CAPS for emphasis)
❌ Faux intimacy ("trust me," "believe me," "I promise")
❌ Preachy declarations ("this is THE best," "you MUST visit")
❌ Unnecessary questions to the reader
❌ Starting sentences with "So," or "Now,"

Sentence Structure Examples

**Good:**

"The pastrami is hand-carved, piled high, served with mustard and a pickle."

"Since 1820. Nothing much has changed."

"What for a hospital, you'll agree, is quite the indicator."

**Bad:**

"You absolutely MUST try the amazing pastrami here!"

"This place is SO charming and cozy, trust me!"

"Now, let me tell you why this is the best spot ever..."

Vocabulary Preferences

**Use:** specific nouns, active verbs, architectural terms, proper names
**Avoid:** fuzzy adjectives, marketing speak, influencer slang

**Replace:**

"hidden gem" → specific description of what makes it notable

"must-visit" → "worth the detour" or just describe it

"incredible views" → "the city spreads out below, no barriers"

"cozy atmosphere" → describe the actual elements (lighting, space, sound)

Structural Patterns

**For place descriptions:**

Address or location first (specific, real)

Historical or contextual fact (year, architect, original purpose)

What it is now (function, not feeling)

One concrete detail that matters

Understated conclusion

**Example:**
"205 East Houston Street. Since 1888. Katz's Delicatessen has fed generations of New Yorkers — and one memorable movie scene. The real reason to come isn't the movie reference. It's the pastrami."
